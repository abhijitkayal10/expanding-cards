# Expanding Cards Project

This project features an interactive and visually appealing card expansion effect. When a user hovers over an image, the card expands to reveal more content or details. It's perfect for use in image galleries, product displays, or content previews.

## Features
- **Hover to Expand:** Cards expand smoothly when the user hovers over an image.
- **Responsive Design:** Works seamlessly on different screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.
- **Customizable:** Easily modify card content, animations, and styles.
- **Lightweight:** Minimal code with no dependencies, making it fast to load

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Markup for structuring the content.
- **CSS3**: Styling the cards and animations.
- **JavaScript**: For any additional dynamic effects or interactions.

## Customization
You can modify the following for your own use:
- **Images**: Change the images in the cards by replacing the image URLs in the HTML.
- **Card Layout**: Modify the number of cards or their arrangement in the `index.html` file.
- **Animation Style**: Edit the CSS to change hover effects like scaling, background color, and transitions.
